/*
Declare the class as final
    This prevents the class from being subclassed, which could otherwise allow mutability through subclass methods.
Make all fields private and final
    This ensures that fields are assigned once inside the constructor and cannot be modified afterward.
Initialize all fields via constructor only
    The constructor should fully initialize the objectâ€™s state. For mutable objects passed in, perform a deep copy to avoid exposing internal references.
Do not provide any setter methods
    No methods should allow modification of fields after construction.
Return copies of mutable objects in getter methods
    If your class contains fields that are mutable objects (e.g., collections, arrays, or custom objects), the getter methods should return defensive copies to prevent clients from modifying the internal state.
Avoid exposing references to mutable internal objects
    This includes returning unmodifiable views or copies of collections.
